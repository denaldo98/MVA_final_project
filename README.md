# Multivariate Analysis final project

Project realized for the course *Multivariate Analysis* at *Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya*. 
 
 - Classification problem based on data coming from a *Marketing campaign of Portuguese banking institution* (data taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tappu0710/marketing-campaigns-of-portuguese-bank?select=bank.csv)). 

 -  We studied the dataset structure and the underlying patterns in order to predict the likelihood of a client to subscribe for the term deposit offered by the Bank. 

 - After applying a preliminary *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*, we tried several classification algorithms in *R*: KNN, SVM, Random Forest, NN.

For in-depth explanation of the work performed, please refer to the provided [report](https://github.com/denaldo98/MVA_final_project/blob/main/report/Project_MVA_report.pdf).

The project is entirely realized using the [R](https://www.r-project.org/) language.

 - The folder [report](https://github.com/denaldo98/MVA_final_project/tree/main/report) contains the pdf files of the final report and also a presentation
 -  `KNN.Rmd, NN.Rmd, SVM.Rmd, random_forest.Rmd` are the R notebook files with the code of the classification algorithms
 - `marketing_classification.Rmd` in the notebook with all the EDA steps performed
 - `.html` files are the *html* files generated from the notebooks
 - `bank.csv` is the dataset file
